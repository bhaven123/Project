Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. It's caused by damage to the
blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). At first, diabetic retinopathy
may cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems. Eventually, it can cause blindness. The
condition can develop in anyone who has Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The longer you have diabetes
and the less controlled your blood sugar is, the more likely you are to develop this eye complication.
Regular screening of the retina through the scans (fundus photography) and through timely check-
ups with the ophthalmologist is the most effective way to manage the disease. Deep neural
networks and the massive screenings of the diabetic patients have enabled us to ease the work of
an ophthalmologist using computer-aided diagnosis. We aim at providing an efficient solution to
ophthalmologists to detect the severities of the Diabetic Retinopathy and accordingly grade them
and also understand the priority the patient should be given for treatment and the approach of
treatment should be practiced and also in the scenario of a numerous scans the application can
help the ophthalmologist prioritize the patient to treat accordingly.
